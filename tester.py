            Welcome to the CIS Compliance Suite Script
    
    Description:
    This script is designed to help you ensure compliance with the 
    Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks for
    Ubuntu Linux 20.04 v2.0.1 - 06-29-2023
    It provides options for system scanning and direct configurations, 
    allowing you to assess and enhance the security posture of your system.
    
    Features:
    - System scanning for CIS benchmarks.
    - Direct configurations to address compliance issues.
    - Logging of configuration changes and scan results.
    
    Usage:
    1. Run the script and choose between scanning for compliance or conducting direct configurations.
    2. Select specific benchmarks or services to scan or configure.
    3. Follow the prompts to complete the selected actions.
    4. View logs for a detailed record of configuration changes and scan results.
    
    Note: Make sure to review the documentation for detailed instructions and best practices.
